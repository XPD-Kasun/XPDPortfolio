# Hi, 

I'm Kasun Jayawardena. Thanks for stopping by at this repository. This repository contains my personal website which is deployed on my main GitHub site.
Instead of providing a top to bottom traditional website, I'm coorporating with my LLM friends to provide you a live chat in which they will answer your questions 
in more interactive way.

I invite you to experience the website and have fun!. If you have any concerns please send me a mail. If you found something not working please open an issue.

Thank you.
